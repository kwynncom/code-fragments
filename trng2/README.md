random noise and signal from a microphone

I'm starting from these:
https://github.com/kwynncom/true-random-numbers-from-microphone
https://github.com/kwynncom/code-fragments/tree/03de339d4af5c4d6a0c1d3d7d1fc36eb385f5673/shortwave

The first program gets 8 random bits out of 32 per sound sample.  The second one is trying to get a signal from all 32 bits.

Now I'm setting up to do a bit of each.  For one, I will seek how many random bits I can get out of 32.  I may also 
continue looking for signals.
