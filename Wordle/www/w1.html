		Below the "src" is an "include," conceptually speaking.  Includes go back to the C language.  An include means a method of 
	adding code to what's available to the code below it.  /opt/kwynn/js/utils.js is a small library I wrote.  It contains 
 onDOMLoad and byid and other stuff.  As to what those do, that's another lesson.  
 
 Note that you can click on utils.js and see the library.  You can also see it when I finish posting the source code.  
 
 All this code is client-side JavaScript.  The reference to C is historical.  
 
 An "include" is otherwise known in different langauges as require or import.

	<p>Right now all that exists is the answer out of 1 letter Wordle, where the only 1 letter words are a and I (using lower case 'i').  
		As you keep refreshing the page, it goes from a to i and back eventually.

				<tr><td id='answerE10'></td></tr>

	<p>Right now, this is entirely client-side JavaScript, or "front end."  You can see everything with Control - U / view HTML source 
		code.

		<p>My apprentice's question was how does she apply anything on this page?  It would be difficult right now.  My idea was to 
			finish 1 letter.  That is, allow the user a guess and give her feedback.  Then I was going to do 2 letters (in, an, to, at,			etc.).  Then I think my apprentice should be able to to take it from there.  
		</p>
		
		<p>Also, I plan to go through this code step by step until it makes partial sense to her.  
			
		</p>
		
		<p>Several days ago she asked how to begin implementing Wordle.  I think it would be wretchedly hard without a lot of 
			examples, so this is the example.
