The problem comes from the debugging being the same parent process.

I think my idea of using the md5 of the command will work in a different context.  The idea will be to turn any kw_shell_exec into a 
semi-service or quasi-service--something that can be easily started from the command line as a separate process tree.  Then client 
debugging will be undisturbed.

Maybe add some /tmp/ hierarchy to the quasi-service PATH.  Upon registration with kw_shell_exec, give the command a simple name to 
put in the path.
