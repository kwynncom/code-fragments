have script either demand starting a server separately or else 
start the server once and demand rerunning
Need a pid file that is not a FIFO

shell_exec(__FILE__ . ' exec ' . $h . ' > /dev/null 2>&1 &');

		$f = '/dev/null';
		$pc = $c . ' > ' . $f . ' 2>&1 & echo $! ';
		$pid = trim(shell_exec($pc));
		
		$tc = "tail -f --pid=$pid /dev/null";
		echo($tc);
		shell_exec($tc);

***
