I will try to use kw short utils.  This needs:

require_once(__DIR__ . '/base62/base62.php'); // I put didCLICallMe() in there
require_once(__DIR__ . '/js/kwjsrecv.php');

<Directory /topsecret>
  SSLRequireSSL
</Directory>

   <Directory "/var/www/html">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Restricted Content"
        AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
        Require valid-user
    </Directory>

-B is blowfish.  The default is (or was) md5, which is bad
-C cost - higher is more secure but slower, default: 5, valid: 4 to 17
-c will truncate ; so I assume 

17 took a very long time
12 was ok
13 ok; upon further thought too long
14 a bit long

# change password
sudo htpasswd -B -C 12 /var/kwynn/tmate/webpasswords blah

sudo htpasswd -B -c -C 17 ./webpasswords blah

sudo htpasswd -B -c -C 10 /etc/apache2/.htpasswd blah

sudo htpasswd -B -c -C 10 /etc/apache2/.htpasswd sammy

sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils


"Therefore, using basic auth and encrypting the whole connection using mod_ssl is a much better alternative."
