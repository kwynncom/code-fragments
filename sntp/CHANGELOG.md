2021/01/18 7:24pm "my time"

Days before, I started from https://github.com/kwynncom/sntp-web-display

Part of the goal was to create an unlimited version to ping my own server many times.  I made 
some other refinements to the basic code while I was at it.

My next changes will be to go back to "arbitrary" servers with a quota, although based on looking 
at the months-old code, I'll probably largely start over.

The other goal this time is for a CLI version as a sanity check against chronyc.
