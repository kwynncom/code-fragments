Move the labeling and graveyards from the top and bottom to the sides. Make sure everything fits on an HD screen. You can make stuff smaller if you want. I don't need your labels for that matter. I do need a turn indicator, though, to tell me if red or blue is moving. Other than that, no labels or verbiage needed.

Sorry. I see the confusion. Let's do scouts as 9, miners as 8, sargeants as 7, ... , general as 2 and marshal as 1, please.

I made it list the piece count, which was correct.  Now I changed it to hard thinking mode to try to get it right.

*******
Changed to 4.1 think fast mode.  Fast-fast mode was very sloppy.  It's taking about 90s to think each time.
Think fast has taken 2:31 to think.

*******
You have way too many bombs, and you covered the front row with bombs so no one can move.
*******
3 initial squares on each side are missing. Also, some of the pieces are "36" and "2B" and such. Your grid / array does not match the board for some reason.

That is your first pass at Stratego.  Follow-ups:

Make the no-mans-land black.  Blue is too confusing.

Some of your pieces are oddly named. And not all 80 initial squares are filled.

Prompt, using Grok 4.1 Fast mode.  2026/02/15 06:25am US Eastern Time.

Please give me code for the board game Stratego. HTML and client-side JavaScript. Start with red and blue players. Use the numbers 1 - 9 where apt. Pick a letter or symbol for others. Start with both sides' pieces visible and any initial board setup you want.
