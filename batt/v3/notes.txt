PHP React
has a lines feature
has a signal handling feature


# clears buffer
adb logcat -c


# current phone - does exactly what I want at a reasonable data rate
# Note that it seems to mix in old timestamps and then maybe stabilizes
# cat'ing adb shell is much faster, but the following will start, well, following the data I want:
adb logcat BatteryService:D *:S


# Android 5
# probably too loud / too much data; haven't tried the above
adb logcat BatteryMeterView:D *:S

If lsusb() is true (perhaps make static?), then adb kill-server
Check for other processes before the older one blanks the output when it's killed.  Separate the functions into ID other and kill other.

Note that I am not accounting for TCP/IP adb

****************
# sudo apt install python3-pyudev

I want a default timeout as given but, if a numerical argument comes in, use that timeout.

$read is stdout
$write  = null;
$except = null;

if (stream_select($read, $write, $except, 0, 200000) > 0)



If I want to background and then exit the calling bash shell, I have to use nohup on the php script.

It's actually dying fairly quickly when it goes into the background.  It's not immediate but ...

Wait, perhaps that's the control-Z
   Grok says no.

There are 18 echo instances.  Probably should make those into a log.


I have a *lot* of udevadm hung or running and such.  Maybe that's the problem.
    Most are from hours ago.
