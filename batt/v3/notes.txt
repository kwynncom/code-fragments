# sudo apt install python3-pyudev

I want a default timeout as given but, if a numerical argument comes in, use that timeout.

$read is stdout
$write  = null;
$except = null;

if (stream_select($read, $write, $except, 0, 200000) > 0)



If I want to background and then exit the calling bash shell, I have to use nohup on the php script.

Wait, perhaps that's the control-Z
   Grok says no.

There are 18 echo instances.  Probably should make those into a log.


I have a *lot* of udevadm hung or running and such.  Maybe that's the problem.
    Most are from hours ago.
