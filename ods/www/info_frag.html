<p>As of mid October, 2025, I am working on two paid software projects.  This shows how many hours and days I am ahead or behind.  With both projects, I am paid a fixed fee per month.  In one case, there is an agreed-upon $ / hour, and thus an agreed upon hours per month.  In the other, I try to keep it the same $ / hour as the first one, even though there is not an agreed-upon amount of work.
</p>

<p>"As of" in the table is the time of my hours-tracking spreadsheets.  "As of" below the table is "now," when you loaded the page.  The spreadsheets are .ODS or LibreOffice Calc.  Then I convert to CSV and POST to kwynn.com.

    <a href='https://github.com/kwynncom/code-fragments/commit/5f34ff83d533da581edbea47be67618011f30e41'>code to a slightly earlier version</a> is on Satan's Source Repo.  You can get to the latest versions from there.  I may promote the code to a more permanent repo soon, or I may not.
