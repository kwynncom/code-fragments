TO DO / TODO: The plan now is to send a small packet to kwynn.com.
Make a simple code.  Put it in /var/kwynn/hours or maybe just use a hash.
Make sure www can read it
Do some error checking on kwjss or whatever?  That is, do some on the old code, not just the currently passed
    result.

Grok 3 Beta wrote me a Python version months ago.  That version could read all sheets (tabs) of a file.
I'm going to use a simpler tool in this case.  I'll delete the Python stuff.
