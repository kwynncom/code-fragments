I considered copying the .csv to kwynn.com.  Thus, the CSV versus PDF process is a bit convoluted.  I tried to make it work with either CSV or PDF.  I may never really test that, though.

TO DO / TODO: The plan now is to send a small packet to kwynn.com.

Grok 3 Beta wrote me a Python version months ago.  That version could read all sheets (tabs) of a file.
I'm going to use a simpler tool in this case.  I'll delete the Python stuff.
