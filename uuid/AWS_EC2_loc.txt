This is part of the input to a UUID based on the location of Kwynn.com (as of late 2020).

This is almost entirely humorous / geekery.

Kwynn.com is an AWS EC2 instance.  It's in us-east-1.  I suspect it's closer to Ashburn than Herndon, but 
below is a location I could find.  Again, I don't know if it (or any other EC2 machine) is in the building below; 
I'm just coming up with something vaguely close to accurate and then making it absurdly precise as if I knew.

Amazon Web Services 12900 Worldgate DR Herndon, VA 20170
(Virginia, USA)

382 feet is roughly the elevation of the base of the building.
So I pick an elevation for my machine below.
